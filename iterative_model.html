 <H1>What is Software Engineering?</H1>
<P>The term “Software engineering” is composed of two words, software and engineering. In computing, the software is a program or set of programs containing instructions especially designed to accomplish a specific task. Essentially, engineering is the process of designing, building, and testing something (like machines, processes, structures, etc.) to serve a specific purpose and solve a problem in a cost-effective manner.
Software Engineering entails understanding and analyzing user requirements, then designing, developing, and testing software applications to meet those needs using scientific principles, procedures and methods. Ultimately, software engineering results in an effective, reliable, and high-quality software product that meets user requirements. Those who create such software applications are known as software engineers or developers. As some engineers develop software applications for clients and companies after analyzing the users’ requirements, others develop the system software for running devices and controlling networks. Organizations and businesses employ it for the development of larger and more complex software systems.</P>
<H1>Principles of Software Engineering</H1>
<P>The following are the principles and tactics we must employ to stay grounded and to make reasonable technical choices based upon requirements, budgets, timelines, and expectations. Living by these principles will help your project progress seamlessly.</P>
